# Mycobacterium tuberculosis target prioritization for virtual screening

This repository contains code for the prioritization of Mtb targets to be used as a target profiling panel. Selection is based on current relevance of the proteins and essentiality and vulnerability data from [Bosch et al, 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00824-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867421008242%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

This work is performed in collaboration with [DaltonTx](https://www.daltontx.com/).
